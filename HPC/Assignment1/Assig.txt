Lab Assignment I
1. To generate the random numbers by using different generator parameters and create a
file as database to be used for realization of matrix operations
2.Perform the matrix basic operations (Addition, Subtraction Multiply, Matrix Inversion,
 (a matrix and a vector)), for different dimensions of the matrix.
3. Multiply 2 matrices A[2000,2000] and B[2000,6000]. Calculate the computational time.
4. Perform parallel program for the matrix operations (Addition, Multiply, (matrix and
 vector)). Calculate the computational time.
